# displayPM_32x4

A display for sensor.community.

This is the result of further development of the main displayPM.
Like promised there, a web interface in the same style as the PM sensor is provided for.

What's new:
- 32 locations, each with 4 separate sensor id's can be followed up.
- Showing results from the DNMS system (digital noise measuring system) from sensor.community.
- Showing the results of Telraam, another project here in Belgium, to count traffic according to category of vehicle.
